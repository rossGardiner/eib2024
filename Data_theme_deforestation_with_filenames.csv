He has also managed to make it more efficient and affordable, meaning they are now creating mini new forests that can replicate old forest ecology in just a few short years. Afforestt has created more than 100 urban forests in India and other parts of the world, and helped to raise awareness about the importance of trees and forests in urban areas. A big part of Shubhendu’s mission is to teach and inspire as many communities as possible to plant forests. The Sikh community in Punjab, led by EcoSikh, have taken Shubhendu’s teachings and run wild. This severely deforested state has seen an explosion of ‘sacred groves’.

Steeping isolates vital enzymes inside the grains that contribute colours and flavours to the beer. The subsequent waste produced from this process is called waste grain. ;;The larvae of black soldier flies have been identified as a high source of protein that can be used in the diets of livestock, as an alternative protein source to soy. The waste grain from the brewing process is collected and used as an effective feed for the black soldier fly during its larval instars.
